### Backup

Before making any major changes, such as updating your theme, it’s important to back up your current theme. This ensures that you can restore your store to its previous state if anything goes wrong.

**Backup Your Current Theme:**
  - To back up your theme, go to **Online Store** > **Themes** in your Shopify admin. Click **Actions** > **Duplicate** next to your active theme. This creates a copy of your current theme, which you can revert to if needed.

Updating your theme ensures that you’re using the latest version with all the latest features and bug fixes. Here’s how to update your theme:

1. **Check for Updates:**

   - Regularly visit your theme provider’s website or check your Shopify admin for notifications about theme updates. Staying informed about updates ensures your store remains compatible with Shopify’s latest features.

2. **Download the Latest Version:**

   - When an update is available, download the updated theme file in `.zip` format from your theme provider. This file will contain all the latest enhancements and fixes.

3. **Upload and Activate the Updated Theme:**
   - Follow the same steps outlined in the **Uploading the Theme to Shopify** section above. After uploading, don’t forget to publish the updated theme to activate it on your store.

### Restore

**Restore a Previous Version (if needed):**
  - If you encounter issues after updating, you can revert to your backup by going to **Online Store** > **Themes**, finding the backup copy in the **Theme library**, and clicking **Actions** > **Publish**.
