This section provides an overview of the individual components in your Shopify theme and explains how layout sections work within the theme editor.

## Editing Sections

The Shopify Theme Editor offers a user-friendly interface that allows you to customize your store's appearance without needing to write or edit code directly.

To access and modify sections in your Shopify theme, follow these steps:

1. **Log in to Shopify Admin:**

   - Visit [shopify.com](https://www.shopify.com) and log in using your store's credentials.

2. **Navigate to Online Store:**

   - From the Shopify Admin dashboard, click on **"Online Store"** in the left-hand menu. This will expand a sub-menu.

3. **Select Themes:**

   - Under **"Online Store"**, click on **"Themes"**. You'll be taken to a page that displays your current theme as well as any other themes you have installed.

4. **Customize the Theme:**

   - On the Themes page, locate your active theme (marked as "Current Theme") and click the **"Customize"** button next to it. This will open the theme editor, where you can modify your theme’s styles and settings.

5. **Navigate to the Template:**

   - In the theme editor, use the left-hand sidebar to locate and select the template you want to edit. Templates often include sections like the header, footer, and content areas.

6. **Edit Sections:**

   - Within the selected template, you can customize various sections of your store’s layout. This includes rearranging sections, changing images, updating text, and adjusting colors. You can also add new sections if needed. Each section can be configured independently, allowing you to tailor the look and functionality of your store to meet your branding and design goals.

7. **Save Your Changes:**

   - After making your adjustments, click **"Save"** to apply the new layout and design settings to your store.

## Common

The home page, often referred to as the index page, is the first impression visitors have of your store. It serves as the central hub where you can showcase your brand, highlight featured products, and guide customers to other important sections of your website. Customizing the home page allows you to create a welcoming and engaging experience that draws visitors in and encourages them to explore more of your store.
