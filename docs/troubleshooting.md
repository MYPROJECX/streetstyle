## Common Issues

Here are some of the most common issues users may encounter, along with steps to resolve them:

### Theme Installation Problems

**Issue:** Theme fails to upload or install.

- **Solution:** Ensure that the theme file is in the correct `.zip` format and not unzipped. Check your internet connection and try uploading the file again. If the problem persists, clear your browser cache or try using a different browser.

### Layout or Design Issues

**Issue:** Layout appears broken or elements are misaligned.

- **Solution:** This could be due to conflicting custom code or outdated browser versions. Disable any custom CSS or JavaScript you’ve added and check the theme on the latest version of a supported browser. If the issue resolves, gradually reintroduce custom code to identify the conflict.

### Missing or Incorrect Images

**Issue:** Images are not displaying correctly or are missing.

- **Solution:** Check that the images have been correctly uploaded to Shopify and are in the supported formats (JPG, PNG). Ensure that the image URLs are correctly linked in the theme settings. Clear your browser cache to see if the images load properly after these checks.

### Slow Loading Times

**Issue:** The store is loading slowly.

- **Solution:** Optimize your images by compressing them to reduce file size. Remove any unnecessary apps or custom scripts that may be slowing down the site. Make sure your theme is updated to the latest version, which may include performance improvements.

### Navigation Issues

**Issue:** Navigation menus are not working or links are broken.

- **Solution:** Check that all menu links are correctly set up in the Shopify admin under **Online Store** > **Navigation**. Ensure that the menu items are properly linked to pages, collections, or products that are published and visible.
